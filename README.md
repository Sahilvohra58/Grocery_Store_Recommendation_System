# Grocery Store Recommendation System

A product recommendation system is made based on daily transaction data (~1.5 million records) of a online grocery store based on copurchase frequency of products. For example, if item A and item B were bought together in 5 separate transactions, their co-purchase frequency is 5.

Due to privacy issues the dataset is not provided in the repository, however you can follow along the code to understand the model.

The code should take around 20 minutes in a normal CPU but can be boosted with GPUs.
